# Troubleshooting

When your application is not behaving as expected:

- Check for any messages in the console
- Check the Network Activity especially any requests to your authorization server
- Check the log data in your [Authok Dashboard](https://manage.authok.cn#/logs)
- Check the `@authok/authok-spa-js` [FAQs](https://github.com/authok/authok-spa-js/blob/master/FAQ.md)

If you believe there is a bug in the SDK, [raise an issue](https://github.com/authok/authok-spa-js/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include all the information required to reproduce the issue.
